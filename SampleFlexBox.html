                    Most people infected with the virus will experience mild to moderate
                    respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.
                    However, some will become seriously ill and require medical attention.
                    Older people and those with underlying medical conditions like
                    cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease,
                    or cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.
                    Anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously ill or die at any age.

                    The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed
                    about the disease and how the virus spreads. Protect yourself and others
                    from infection by staying at least 1 metre apart from others, wearing a
                    properly fitted mask, and washing your hands or using an alcohol-based rub 
                    frequently. Get vaccinated when its your turn and follow local guidance.

                    The virus can spread from an infected persons mouth or nose in small
                    liquid particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe.
                    These particles range from larger respiratory droplets to smaller aerosols.
                    It is important to practice respiratory etiquette, for example by coughing
                    into a flexed elbow, and to stay home and self-isolate until you recover
                    if you feel unwell.
